mutate_fail-terminal-datasets() { ## [--commit]: Causes the output datasets of jobs which were manually failed, to be marked as failed
	handle_help "$@" <<-EOF
		Whenever an admin marks a job as failed manually (e.g. by updating the
		state in the database), the output datasets are not accordingly updated
		by default. And this causes users to mistakenly think their jobs are
		still running when they have long since failed.

		This command provides a way to select those jobs in error states
		(deleted, deleted_new, error, error_manually_dropped,
		new_manually_dropped), find their associated output datasets, and fail
		them with a blurb mentionining that they should contact the admin in
		case of any question

		Running without any arguments will execute the command within a
		transaction and then roll it back, allowing you to see counts of rows
		and giving you an idea if it is doing the right thing.

		**WARNINGS**

		This does NOT currently work on collections

		**EXAMPLES**

		The process is to first query how many datasets will be failed, if this looks correct you're ready to go.

		    $ gxadmin mutate fail-terminal-datasets
		    BEGIN
		    SELECT 1
		    jobs_per_month_to_be_failed | count
		    -----------------------------+-------
		    2019-02-01 00:00:00         |     1
		    (1 row)

		    UPDATE 1
		    UPDATE 1
		    ROLLBACK

		Then to run with the --commit flag to commit the changes

		    $ gxadmin mutate fail-terminal-datasets --commit
		    BEGIN
		    SELECT 1
		    jobs_per_month_to_be_failed | count
